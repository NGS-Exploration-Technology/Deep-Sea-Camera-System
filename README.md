## Deep Sea Camera System Technical Specifications
The DSCS is a tetherless, portable device that can be deployed off the side of a boat. They sink to the seafloor to take sensor readings and record video of deep ocean biodiversity. After releasing their anchor, they float back to the surface automatically. 

Features:
4K video capture
Can be easily be operated by a team of two.
Data management: Depth, time, and pressure
17-in and 13-in versions
